# Custom Mobs
This folder contains several precreated mobs for this plugin. These mobs will be downloaded into your plugin folder if the folder mobs does not exist yet or is deleted. This folder may be extended by community upload of mobs.

Every mob has 1 in 5 chance of not hitting the castle, it will also calculate a damage range between the Attack Damage & 66% of Attack Damage. Also every hit on castle will reduce mobs health in between 0.20 up to 0.85.
